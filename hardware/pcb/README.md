## Design Overview

- Compact **round PCB** designed to fit the Mini TurtleBot chassis.  
- Hosts the **Raspberry Pi Pico W** module at the center.  
- Breakout connectors for:
  - **Motors & Servos** (PWM headers)  
  - **LiDAR** module  
  - **IR sensors** (IR1 / IR2)  
  - **OLED display**  
  - **MPU-6050 IMU**  
- Integrated **battery connector**, power switch, and indicator LEDs.  
- Optimized for **educational assembly** and **research prototyping**.

## Fabrication Notes

- **Board size:** ~75 mm circular (fits robot frame).  
- **Layers:** 2-layer PCB.  
- **Copper weight:** 1 oz copper recommended.  
- **Finish:** HASL (low cost) or ENIG (better durability).  
- **Min track/spacing:** 6/6 mil (compatible with JLCPCB, PCBWay, OSH Park).  

Upload the provided **Gerber ZIP** to a PCB manufacturer for fabrication.

## Assembly Notes

- Mount the **Pico W** on headers (allows easy replacement/debugging).  
- Solder motor drivers, connectors, and sensors as per schematic.  
- Pay attention to **battery polarity** and **orientation of ICs**.  
- LEDs and push buttons are optional but recommended for debugging.
